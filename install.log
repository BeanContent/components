 >  NX   Nx CLI is not installed globally.

   This means that you might have to use "yarn nx" or "npx nx" to execute commands in the 
workspace.
   Run "yarn global add nx" or "npm install -g nx" to be able to execute command directly.


 >  NX   Distributed caching via Nx Cloud has been enabled

   In addition to the caching, Nx Cloud provides config-free distributed execution,
   UI for viewing complex runs and GitHub integration. Learn more at https://nx.app

No recent branch associated runs found

We didn't find any recent runs for this workspace that are 
tied to a branch. You can click on the "Show all runs" 
toggle to show all runs.

If you want to see one quickly, you can run the following 
command locally in your workspace.

NX_BRANCH=testing npx nx run-many -t build

Passing the NX_BRANCH variable lets us simulate setting a 
branch ID in CI. Normally when you run a command locally, it 
will not have a branch associated with it.
