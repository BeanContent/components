 >  NX   Nx CLI is not installed globally.

   This means that you might have to use "yarn nx" or "npx nx" to execute commands in the 
workspace.
   Run "yarn global add nx" or "npm install -g nx" to be able to execute command directly.

   In addition to the caching, Nx Cloud provides config-free distributed execution,
   UI for viewing complex runs and GitHub integration. Learn more at https://nx.app
